## user swipe to change images...

![Alt text](screenshots/screenA.png?raw=true "screen A")
![Alt text](screenshots/screenB.png?raw=true "screen B")
![Alt text](screenshots/screenC.png?raw=true "screen C")
![Alt text](screenshots/screenD.png?raw=true "screen D")

## method
we can either use story board to create gesture recongizer or code it manually. In this practice, I will use story board to create gesture for left and right swipe while up and down swipe will implement by manual coding.  

![Alt text](screenshots/imageview_interaction.png?raw=true "view interaction enable")  
whatever which method you use, you should first enable interaction for specific view.

## story board method
![Alt text](screenshots/imageview_with2gesture.png?raw=true "imageview gesture linkage")  
by dragging your gesture to specific view, you should see their linkage right here  

![Alt text](screenshots/left_swipe_action.png?raw=true "left swipe gesture")
![Alt text](screenshots/right_swipe_action.png?raw=true "right swipe gestur")  
and for the gesture on storyboard, you should see their related IBAction too.
